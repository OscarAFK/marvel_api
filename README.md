This application allows you to browse through characters from the Marvel universe, and choose them on for your Superteam.
I made this application to train myself on Node.js and React, using the Marvel API. More infos about it [here](https://developer.marvel.com/documentation/getting_started/)

## How to setup

First, you need to have a Marvel account. Then you need to go to [your account](https://developer.marvel.com/account), and get your public and private keys. You will need to fill them in on the login page of the application to make it work.

## Running the app

To run the app, launch the following command in your favorite terminal:
```
docker compose up
```

You can now view it in your internet browser at the following address:
```
localhost:3000
```
